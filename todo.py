# TODO: Enhanced Caesar Cipher Cryptanalysis Implementation Plan
#   1. Compile reference data for English letter, bigram, and trigram frequencies.
#   2. Extend frequency analysis to include bigrams and trigrams.
#   3. Develop a function to apply shift (0-25) and compare encrypted text frequencies to reference data.
#   4. Implement a scoring system for each shift based on frequency analysis.
#   5. Create a decision mechanism to choose the most probable key based on scores.
#   6. Incorporate handling for edge cases and very short texts.
#   7. Conduct thorough testing with various text lengths and compositions.
#   8. Document the implementation and refine based on test results.
